# AnomalyDetection
A model for anomaly detection in data collected from many devices, where each device has a set of sensors. The target is to identify the devices that are manifesting anomalous behaviors, and within the detected anomalous devices, to identify which sensors are more likely to be faulty, thus must be inspected first.
